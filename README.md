# Decentralized Voting System with Real-Time Results

## Project Description
The **Decentralized Voting System** is a blockchain-based application designed to provide secure, transparent, and anonymous voting. Built on the Internet Computer (ICP) ecosystem, it leverages **Motoko** for backend processing and integrates real-time results visualization on the frontend. This system ensures fairness in elections and prevents tampering while maintaining voter anonymity.


## Features
1. **User Authentication**
   - Secure login using Internet Identity for unique voter identification.

2. **Election Creation**
   - Admins can create new elections and define candidates or issues.

3. **Voting Mechanism**
   - Registered voters can cast one vote per election.
   - Votes are stored securely in decentralized canisters.

4. **Real-Time Results**
   - Live vote counts displayed using charts and graphs.
   - Automatic updates ensure users see trends as they happen.

5. **Anonymity and Integrity**
   - Cryptographic techniques safeguard voter anonymity and data integrity.

6. **Past Election Records**
   - Archived results available for previous elections.


## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with SCSS for styling
- **Backend**: Motoko on the Internet Computer (ICP)
- **Authentication**: Internet Identity
- **Visualization**: Chart.js for real-time result graphs
